            Inspirations

            The spell was based off Warwick's W: Blood Hunt from League of Legends.

            I loved the fear and panic his spell induces when
            you are on the receiving end of it.
          - |
            Lore Part 1:
            Cruvenan is a mixture of two latin words.

            'Cru' comes from Cruor which means bloodshed/slaughter

            'Venan' comes from venator which means hunter/tracksman

            Together, it makes Bloodshed Hunter.
          - |
            Lore Part 2:
            I think that his role as a ruthless, merciless king that steps on anything to keep his throne on is the perfect villian for a spell like this.

            One who forces his commands on others with a strong enough will
          - |
            Lore Part 3:
            to literally force his soul to continue even after death envokes the strong desire for blood. He doesn't randomly start killing either.

            Him feeding the weak to the dogs is proof that he discriminately kills and doesn't ponder any of it.

            The spell has...

            Kill Reset and Stacking

            Custom Death Event

            A rush of adrenaline when you run towards someone from 80m away.

            Small portion of lore on the hunter cast-item
          - |
            The spell has a few problems that I'm able to fix mostly because of Area Effect Spells

            - Targets other monsters when not supposed to.
            - If opped, will double-cast the AOE spells if cost is ignored.
          - |
            - I also happen to be to far gone to add helper-spell: true to the 900 line spell. xd

            - It will slightly bug the speed if more than 1 target is available
          - |
            To avoid issues...
            Target players only for the best experience
            Each target should ~130m or ~5m from each other.
            Cast the spell 80m away from a player for the most fun
            Be opped.
            Have plently of ram on your server. 2GB should do.
